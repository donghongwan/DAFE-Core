- **User  Interface**: The front-end application that allows users to interact with the DAFE ecosystem.

## Technology Stack
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (or other chosen blockchain)
- **Smart Contract Language**: Solidity
- **Front-End Framework**: React.js (or other chosen framework)
- **Back-End Framework**: Node.js (or other chosen framework)
